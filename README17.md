# OS_K17SM_B42

This project is for the scheduling proceses in CPU. It has two algorithms in it, one is 
shortest job first while the other is longest job first.
Shortest job first chooses the process from the queue which has less burst time and schedules the the processes.
Longest job first chooses the process from the queue which has more burst time.
In this project I have provided two functions one for sjf and another for ljf.
The user has to input process name, arrival time and burst time, then the user would be asked for 
the type of scheduling algorithm it has to proceed with, and the result will be according to the chosen job 
scheduling algorithm.
The user hs to enter the arival time, while the burst time will be double of it according to given scenerio.
