In this question the scheduler will execute according to shortest job first and also maintain a 
queue that keeps the record of the execution of all the process, hence the Round Robin Algorithm is used.
The CPU starts after 3 time units, prior to this it doesn't entertain any execution.
The user has to input the arrival time and burst time. The final output will display Average 
waiting time and Average turn around time.
